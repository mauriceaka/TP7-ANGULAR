## TP7-ANGULAR
TP 7 represents the setting up of a <strong> pokedex </strong>. The pokedex, is an encyclopaedia allowing to count, 
to record information on the pokémons.To do this we used angular as a programming technology because
it offers a wide range of functionality to perform several treatments. Let's start our adventure.


## Notable features
The aim of the project is to learn Angular by incorporating some of its features such as:
<li>Searching via an identifier
<li>Searching in a list
<li>Integration of existing components
<li>Access to an API
<li>Communication between controllers


## Getting Started
Clone the project: https://github.com/mauriceaka/TP7-ANGULAR.git

## Prerequisites
<li>node installation on the nodejs.org website
<li>Verify the installation by typing in the node -v command prompt which should return the version of node.
<li>Install angular command line interface tool (Angular CLI) via npm install -g @angular/cli.
<li>IDE(Eclipse, Intelliji Idea etc…)

## Start-up
To start the project, you need to open the <stron>pokdemo</strong> folder and then run the <strong>ng serve</strong> or <strong>npm start</strong> command
from your IDE command line in <strong>the pokdemo folder or from your folder tree while in pokdemo </strong> at a command prompt run ng serve or npm start
We have two forms, one of which is read-only and the other is read-write.
The writeable one immediately modifies the readable one.
The second form allows you to search the Pokémon database represented by the drop-down menu at the end.
the drop-down menu displays the selected pokémon, the go button displays its characteristics and its identifier.


## Built With
<li>node is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to create scalable network applications.
l<i>Angular is a JavaScript framework for creating web applications, especially single page applications.
